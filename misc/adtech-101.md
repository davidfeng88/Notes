Comment: this post was published on 12/18/2019, but I thought after [Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) in 2018 Facebook stopped using third-party cookies. Maybe I'm wrong. I think in general the ad tech industry is moving away from third-party cookies due to privacy concerns, which is a good thing.
