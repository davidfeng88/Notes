## [Your Professional Growth Questionnaire](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/your-professional-growth-questionnaire/)

Probably need to review these questions every quarter.

### The Current Gig

* What are your strengths? How do you know that?
* What do you need to work on? How do you know that? How are you working on this area? Is your company helping?
* How long have you been at the current company?
* How long have you been in the current role?
* When was your last promotion of role? How was this communicated to you? What is the one thing you believe you did to earn this promotion?
* When was your last compensation increase? \(Compensation = Base salary, bonus, and/or stock\)
* Do you feel fairly compensated? If not, why? If not, what would you consider fair compensation? What facts do you base that opinion on? Have you told this to your manager?
* When was the last time you received feedback from your manager?
* What compliment do you wish you could receive about your work?
* Are you learning from your manager? What was the last significant thing you learned from them?
* What was the last thing you built at work that you enjoyed?
* What was your last major failure at work? What’d you learn?
* What was the last piece of feedback you received \(from anyone\) that substantively changed your working style?
* Who is your mentor? When was the last time you met with them?
* When was the last 360? What was your biggest lesson? \(A 360 is a process where a neutral party gathers feedback from all the humans in your working sphere. Your managers, your peers, and if you’re a manager, your direct reports. I try to do a 360 every three years because the synthesized feedback is always revealing.\)

### The Next Gig

* When did you last change jobs? Why?
* When did you last change companies? Why?
* What aspect of your current job would you bring with you to a future gig?
* What is your dream job? \(Role, company, etc.\)
* What is a company you admire? What attributes do you admire?
* Who is a leader that you admire? What are the qualities of that leader that you admire?
