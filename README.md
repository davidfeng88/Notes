## Practical Courses

Recently on Hacker News, I saw a discussion about [Hacker Tools](https://hacker-tools.github.io/), an MIT course/workshop for common tools used in software development. I'm sure resources \(free and not free\) on those topics can be found online, but it's really handy if they are organized as a course. In the discussion people shared several similar courses, and I have compiled a list of covered topics below.

Several topics are ubiquitous \(i.e. they are important\): Unix Shell \(Bash\), Text Editor \(Vim\), Version control \(Git\). They are important tools for almost all software engineers, no matter what language/library you use. Make sure to master those skills.

## Lazy Loading Learning

Nowadays we simply have too much information. One way to handle that is "lazy load" the material: learn it when you need it. Below is the some resources I collected over time, waiting to be lazy loaded üòÄ
