# Misc Digest - Writing Ideas

## About Life

[Differences between kids and grown-ups](https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16678) **Part 1**

> * Kids thinks that there are two kinds of people in the world: the good guys and the bad guys. The bad guys are bad for no reason. We are good. They are bad.
> * Kids thinks that you work hard enough, you'll get what you want.
> * Grown-ups know that to persuade other people you need to offer something they want/need.

**Part 2** [https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16683](https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16683)

Kids think other people \(e.g. parents, teachers\) should be responsible for their life. Grown-ups take charge of their own life. \(instead of blaming it on bad boss, colleagues, spouse, client, government, etc.\)

**Writing Idea:** I probably learned this in graduate school =&gt; the student should take initiatives, instead of waiting on advisor.

[Somewhere people vs. anywhere people](https://www.zhihu.com/question/379923494/answer/1114344319)

Interesting idea. In the era of globalization, you probably want to become an "anywhere person".

**Writing Idea:** why do you limit yourself in one location? One industry? Transferrable skills?

## About How to Spend Your Time

[Stop Reading the News](https://fs.blog/2013/12/stop-reading-news/)

> * Simply put, the value of news is not that high. You won't miss anything if you don't read the news. Spend the time on something that's more valuable.

[Learn to Sell, Learn to Build](https://nav.al/build-sell)

**Writing Idea**: Definitely one of the most important lesson I learned during graduate school is that we should learn to sell. Presentation Skills. Chinese students vs. Domestic students.
