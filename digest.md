# Misc Digest - Writing Ideas

## About Life

[Differences between kids and grown-ups](https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16678) **Part 1**

> * Kids thinks that there are two kinds of people in the world: the good guys and the bad guys. The bad guys are bad for no reason. We are good. They are bad.
> * Kids thinks that you work hard enough, you'll get what you want.
> * Grown-ups know that to persuade other people you need to offer something they want/need.

**Part 2** [https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16683](https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16683)

Kids think other people \(e.g. parents, teachers\) should be responsible for their life. Grown-ups take charge of their own life. \(instead of blaming it on bad boss, colleagues, spouse, client, government, etc.\)

**Writing Idea:** I probably learned this in graduate school =&gt; the student should take initiatives, instead of waiting on advisor.

[Somewhere people vs. anywhere people](https://www.zhihu.com/question/379923494/answer/1114344319)

Interesting idea. In the era of globalization, you probably want to become an "anywhere person".

**Writing Idea:** why do you limit yourself in one location? One industry? Transferrable skills?

## About How to Spend Your Time

[Stop Reading the News](https://fs.blog/2013/12/stop-reading-news/)

> * Simply put, the value of news is not that high. You won't miss anything if you don't read the news. Spend the time on something that's more valuable.

[Learn to Sell, Learn to Build](https://nav.al/build-sell)

**Writing Idea**: Definitely one of the most important lesson I learned during graduate school is that we should learn to sell. Presentation Skills. Chinese students vs. Domestic students.

## Economy / Society

“印度化”有如下特点：

1、上、下层生殖隔离，互相不通婚，类似有种姓制度。

2、国内有2%的世界级精英，10%的正常人，剩下的是糊涂蛋；大家住在一起，但互相没义务。

3、少量上层精英，接受精英教育；其他大部分下层人，接受随机教育，自生自灭，自由发展。事实上整个国家很自由，上、下层互相没有义务。你爱干啥干啥，只要不影响其他人，想干啥都没人管你，倒了霉也没人管你。

4、整个国家宗教氛围浓厚，老百姓都有种“认命”的美德；越底层越反智，连基本的科学常识都不接受。

6、政府内部各自为政，也就是大家说的，“散装的”。

国家财政吃紧，从富人收不上税（利益集团游说减税），压力主要在中产。无法投资教育，底层只能“快乐教育“。
