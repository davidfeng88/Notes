# Public Speaking

## Preparation

* Identify your audience.
* What is the goal of the speech: persuade? Inform? Inspire/entertain?
* Write an outline first.
* "Let me tell you a story." Stories are more memorable than facts and numbers. Good stories contains conflicts and creativity.

## Open

* Develop credibility: show confidence and competence \(two key details in your background on the subject matter\)
* Five cold openings: 
  * ask an open-ended question;
  * begin with a story;
  * begin with a bold statement;
  * tell the audience to imagine something;
  * begin with hard evidence \(Must be credible\).
* Common opening mistakes:
  * start with something trite;
  * clear the throat;
  * highlight technical/personal insecurities.

### Handle tech mishaps

* Over-prepare: always bring backups - laptop, remote, etc.
* Know the material well so that you could speak without the slides.
* Last move: get the audience involved in the problem.

## Close

### Q & A

* Let your audience know how you'll handle Q&A. Jump-in anytime \(small group\) or a dedicated time.
* Hold your Q&A near the end, not at the end. "I have a one final thought to leave you with, but before I do, I'll open up the floor for questions." This handles the no-question scenario, and you'll have the control of the final words.
* Repeat the question when the room is large.
* Keep the answer brief. If you can't answer the question within one minute, say so. "It's a complicated question, and a comprehensive answer might take an hour. I'll give a shorter answer, and in the interest of time, I'll take another question."

### Closing words

* Rephrase the title.
* Summary: key takeaways.
* A relevant quote. Make sure that the audience likes the author.
* Personal tagline: for repeated internal presentations to the same audience.
* A call to action.
