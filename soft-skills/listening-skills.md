# Listening Skills

* How to stop interrupting people: take notes, focus on your breath \(when you feel angry\)
* Make proper eye contact
* Restate what the other people said in your own words
* Ask open-end questions: Why is that? How did that make you feel? Help me understand. What's your solution? \(Don't always try to be the smarter person in the room\)

### How to listen to a boring/annoying person

| They are ... | You can ... |
| :--- | :--- |
| passionate about something you are not interested | ask how did they become interested in it |
| repetitive | tell them you already got the information |
| angry | if it's your fault, apologize. Else, restate the situation, understand their needs, show them what you can do to help |
| just having a different worldview | ask them for a reason |
