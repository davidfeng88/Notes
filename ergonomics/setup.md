# Setup

**Chair**

* Most often you won't need the arm rests. Put them all the way down.
* Adjust your back support, both upper and lower parts.
* Don't recline. Use the upright position.
* Sit the "full" chair, with only 2-4 finger length between the front of chair and your lower leg.

**Desk**

* Adjust the desk height so that the bottom of desk is 1-1.5 inches above your leg.

**Monitor**

* Adjust the height so that your eye is at the center of the monitor
* When you lay back on the chair, you should be able to read without leaning forward

**Sit/Stand**

* Standing itself has no evidence of being healthier than sitting. It's the stand up action that's beneficial.
* Don't stand for too long \(&gt;20 min\), since then your feet become tired and your posture become bad.
* Don't sit for too long \(&gt;40 min\). Take a bathroom break. Make sure your chair is comfortable.
